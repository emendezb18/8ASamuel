            NORTH KOREANS INVADE SOUTH KOREA
            Troops from Communist-dominated North Korea launched a series of attacks across the border into American-backed South Korea early Sunday, fragmentary reports from the frontier said.
            Reports from the 38th parallel, which divides the Northern and Southern parts of Korea, said that attacks were launched generally along the border.
            They said the North Koreans were supported by tanks in the Chunchon area, 50 miles northeast of Seoul.
            The border area has been the scene of frequent guerilla clashes between North and South Koreans.</p> <hr>

    <h1 class="do"><center>Political Changes After The War:
    </center></h1>
    
    <p class="P"> DIVISION OF KOREA:
        The Korean War led to the division of Korea into two separate states along the 38th parallel  North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) and South Korea (Republic of Korea)
        The division deepened the ideological and political differences between the communist North, supported by the Soviet Union and China, and the anti-communist South, supported by the United States and its allies.

<p class="P"> CHINESE INVOLVEMENT:
    China's entry into the war on the side of North Korea had significant consequences. The intervention of Chinese forces prolonged the conflict and increased the scale of the war. It also heightened tensions between the United States and China, contributing to a long period of hostility between the two countries during the Cold War.
    
          
        <p> 
            STRENGTHENING OF THE COLD WAR:
The Korean War was one of the early conflicts of the Cold War, pitting communist forces against anti-communist forces. The war heightened tensions between the United States and its allies on one side and the Soviet Union and China on the other. The Cold War rivalry became more pronounced in Asia, influencing subsequent events in the region.</p>

        <p class="P"> MILITARY ALLIANCES:
            The Korean War had a lasting impact on military alliances in the region. The United States solidified its alliances with countries like South Korea and Japan, establishing a strong military presence in the Asia-Pacific region. 
        </center></h1>
            
        <p class="P"> ARMISTICE AGREEMENT:
            The Korean War ended in 1953 with an armistice agreement, not a formal peace treaty. This meant that technically, North and South Korea remained in a state of war.
